#assignment-expense-management-app

This is an assignment given to me for selection purpose.
Here I will be using angular js 1.x to operate CRUD operations for the product pricing and product items.

What I have tried to do here is display a list of clients. On click of each client, a popup will open which will show some basic detail. Later when he wants to view his transaction detail he could click on the button which will redirect him to the page which shows details of him and his transactions.

Due to time constraint I have defaulted it to random user's info irrespective of the client the user clicks on.
